# Parcellate-PereiraVisE1
Using Cory Shain's parcellation method to examine the functional organization of semantically consistent voxels, using data from Expt. 1 of Pereira et al. 2018.

To run parcellation on your own experiment, work within the `scripts` directory to generate the appropriate setup files, similar to what is currently in `scripts/pereiraE1_sem.py`.
